function [x] = HMM(p,pi,b,y)
%% This function implements the Viterbi algorithm, to find the most likely
% sequence of states given some set of observations.
%
%% INPUT
%  p is a matrix of transition probabilies for states x;
%  pi is a vector of prior distributions for states x;
%  b is a matrix of emission probabilities;
%  y is a vector of observations.
%
%% OUTPUT
% x is the most likely sequence of states, given the inputs.

m=length(pi);
